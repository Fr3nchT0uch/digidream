### Missing tools

The PYM format is an optimized YM format based on a recreated partition by analyzing patterns contained in a YM file. It uses only Packbits (RLE-like) compression.  
It is so inspired by the FYM format of fenarinarsa that I even took up its description!   
The generator is coded in Python and is a ultra secret tool! I will distribute it when I am no longer ashamed of the code...
